# Introduction

## Overview

> Wreathe makes it possible to build server-side rendered, single-page applications using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and the UI framework of your choice. :rocket:

* [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

### Why wreathe?

The article [Server-side apps with client-side rendering](https://reinink.ca/articles/server-side-apps-with-client-side-rendering), which Jonathan Reinink published on his blog in 2019 looked very promising as an alternative to [spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering). When [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) was subsequently released, it looked like the next rising star.

However, due to the lack of development, unanswered issues and pull requests at Inertia, we decided to continue developing a fork under the name `wreathe`.

### Our current roadmap

Application related:

* __Improve application performance__ - Optimize the application performance and reduce required dependencies.
* __Expand the test suite__ - Add `Vitest` and test suites for better code control.

Community related:

* __Collaborate with community members__ - Issue prioritization will be based on community feedback, please share your thoughts!
* __Improve user & developer experience__ - Optimize the docs, examples, starter-kits, workspace- and user-tools continuously.
