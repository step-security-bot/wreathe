## Make changes to the code or docs

Your patches are welcome. Here's our suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **master** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch.

This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

Make sure you read and follow the instructions in the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md). And note
